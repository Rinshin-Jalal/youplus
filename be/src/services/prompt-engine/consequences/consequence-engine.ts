/**
 * Consequence Engine - Accountability and Behavioral Change System
 *
 * This module generates consequences for user failures and excuses during
 * accountability calls. It provides different levels of intensity based on
 * user performance patterns and creates psychological pressure to drive
 * behavioral change.
 *
 * Consequence Types:
 * 1. Harsh Consequences: For users with poor performance (<40% success rate)
 * 2. Standard Consequences: For moderate performance issues (learning-focused)
 *
 * Psychological Principles:
 * - Harsh consequences create urgency and break through denial
 * - Standard consequences focus on learning and system improvement
 * - Consequences are designed to trigger emotional responses
 * - Random selection prevents predictability and maintains impact
 *
 * Usage Guidelines:
 * - Use harsh consequences sparingly to maintain impact
 * - Standard consequences should be the default approach
 * - Consequences should be followed by actionable solutions
 * - Always maintain the relationship while applying pressure

/**
 * Generates harsh consequences for users with poor performance patterns
 *
 * These consequences are designed to break through denial and create
 * urgency for change. They use direct, confrontational language to
 * highlight the cost of continued failure patterns.
 *
 * Target Users:
 * - Success rate below 40%
 * - Repeated excuse patterns
 * - Serious intervention needed
 * - Users stuck in comfort zones
 *
 * Psychological Impact:
 * - Creates emotional discomfort
 * - Highlights opportunity cost
 * - Breaks through rationalization
 * - Forces self-confrontation
 *
 * @returns A randomly selected harsh consequence message

 * Target Users:
 * - Moderate performance issues
 * - Learning-focused accountability
 * - Users who respond to constructive feedback
 * - Situations requiring gentle but firm guidance
 *
 * Psychological Impact:
 * - Maintains relationship quality
 * - Encourages self-reflection
 * - Focuses on solutions
 * - Builds problem-solving skills
