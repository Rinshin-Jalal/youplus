/**
 * VoIP Call Tracker Service
 *
 * This module tracks sent VoIP calls and detects when users don't acknowledge them.
 * It implements a timeout-based system that automatically triggers retry logic
 * when calls go unanswered for a specified period.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Tracks all sent calls with unique UUIDs
 * - Implements 10-minute timeout for call acknowledgment
 * - Automatically triggers retry logic on timeout
 * - Clears tracking when calls are acknowledged
 * - Provides debugging and monitoring capabilities
 *
 * Call Lifecycle:
 * 1. Call sent → Tracked with timeout
 * 2. User answers → Acknowledged, tracking cleared
 * 3. User ignores → Timeout triggers retry logic
 * 4. Retry sent → New tracking cycle begins
