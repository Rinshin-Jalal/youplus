## Strategic Emphasis Guide

### Words/Phrases to Emphasize (ALL CAPS or Bold):

**Identity & Transformation:**
- REALLY, BIGGEST LIE, WHO (identity questions)
- COMPLETELY GAVE UP, STARTED FRESH
- LOSER VERSION, UNRECOGNIZABLE, NO LONGER, BECOMING

**Pressure & Accountability:**
- RIGHT NOW, EVERY SINGLE DAY, EXACT
- WEAKNESS WINDOW, KILLING
- HATE, BAD (intensity)
- EVERY NIGHT, BREAK YOUR PROMISE

**Commitment & Action:**
- ONE (singular focus)
- STRAIGHT, WILLING TO SACRIFICE
- WAR CRY, OATH, SEAL

**Confrontation:**
- SABOTAGE, SOPHISTICATED EXCUSE
- ACTUALLY (calling out bullshit)
- DISAPPOINTED

### Why This Works:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Emphasis creates scanning points for key concepts
2. **Vocal Stress**: If read aloud, emphasis shows where to add pressure
3. **Psychological Weight**: Capitalized words hit harder, feel more serious
4. **Urgency Creation**: Words like RIGHT NOW, EVERY, EXACT demand immediacy
5. **Identity Anchoring**: WHO, BECOMING, NO LONGER frame transformation

### Implementation Notes:

- Keep ALL explanation steps (1, 4, 8, 13, 17, 21, 25, 28, 32, 36, 40, 45) exactly as written
- Question steps are now one-liners with strategic emphasis
- All DB fields match original 100%
- All step types, min durations, and options preserved
- Helper text maintained where it existed (Steps 11, 29)
