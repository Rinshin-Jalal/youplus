## Design Strategy

### Three Categories of New Steps

1. **Phase Transition Bridges** (9 steps) - Connect major psychological phases
2. **Micro-Explanations** (3 steps) - Reinforce why certain questions matter
3. **Micro-Commitment Confirmations** (3 steps) - Create acknowledgment checkpoints

---

## Category 1: Phase Transition Bridges (9 Steps)

### NEW STEP 6A: After Step 5 (Before Excuse Discovery)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 5 (biggest_lie) and Step 6 (favorite_excuse)
**Phase**: `.warningInitiation` → `.excuseDiscovery` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You just admitted your biggest lie.
Everyone does.

But here's the difference:
Most people confess and feel better.
You're about to get WORSE.

Because I'm going to show you:
- Your excuse library
- Your quit pattern
- Your weakness schedule

And you'll see it's all the same.
Every. Single. Time.

Ready to meet your excuses?
```

**Purpose**: Bridge from initial honesty to systematic excuse discovery. Sets expectation that awareness will be uncomfortable.

---

### NEW STEP 12A: After Step 11 (Before Consequence Confrontation)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 11 (dual sliders) and Step 12 (time_waster)
**Phase**: `.excuseDiscovery` → `.excuseConfrontation` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
Your fire levels?
Recorded.

But motivation is a LIE.
It comes and goes.

What matters is CONSEQUENCE.

The REAL pain you're avoiding:
- Mirror shame
- Relationship damage
- The person you're becoming

Time to see what you're ACTUALLY losing.
```

**Purpose**: Transition from identifying excuses to confronting real consequences. Reframes from motivation to accountability.

---

### NEW STEP 17A: After Step 16 (Before Reality Extraction)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 16 (physical_disgust_trigger) and Step 17 (reality check)
**Phase**: `.excuseConfrontation` → `.patternAwareness` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You felt that.
In the mirror.
That's real.

But feelings without DATA?
That's just self-pity.

Now I need NUMBERS:
- Where your time went yesterday
- How many times you've quit this year
- The ONE thing you'll actually do

Feelings lie.
Numbers don't.
```

**Purpose**: Bridge from emotional confrontation to concrete reality audit. Establishes data as superior to feelings.

---

### NEW STEP 22A: After Step 21 (Before Pattern Analysis)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 21 (pattern awareness) and Step 22 (financial_consequence)
**Phase**: `.patternAwareness` → `.patternAnalysis` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
"This time is different."

I've heard it 247 times.
From people smarter than you.
Stronger than you.
More motivated than you.

They all had your commitment.

The difference?
I'm going to find your PATTERN.
The hidden software running your life.

Financial costs.
Intellectual excuses.
Parental guilt.

Let's see what ACTUALLY controls you.
```

**Purpose**: Transition from commitment to deep pattern analysis. Establishes that intention isn't enough - need to understand unconscious patterns.

---

### NEW STEP 28A: After Step 27 (Before Identity Rebuild)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 27 (success_memory) and Step 28 (identity_goal)
**Phase**: `.patternAnalysis` → `.identityRebuild` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You just described success.
ONE time you followed through.

That person still exists inside you.
Buried under excuses.
Suffocating under comfort.

Now I'm going to EXTRACT them.

WHO you want to become.
WHAT proves you changed.
WHAT event would force you.

Because hoping doesn't work.
Planning does.
```

**Purpose**: Bridge from analyzing past to building future identity. Reframes success memory as proof that change is possible.

---

### NEW STEP 33A: After Step 32 (Before Commitment System)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 32 (biggest_enemy) and Step 33 (commitment stats)
**Phase**: `.identityRebuild` → `.commitmentSystem` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You know WHO you want to be.
You know WHAT you're fighting.

But knowing changes NOTHING.

Statistics don't lie:
- 90% quit by Day 7
- 99% quit by Day 30

Why?
They had no SYSTEM.
No external accountability.
No consequence for quitting.

Time to build your cage.
```

**Purpose**: Transition from identity vision to commitment mechanics. Establishes that system > willpower.

---

### NEW STEP 39A: After Step 38 (Before War Mode)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 38 (sacrifice_list) and Step 39 (war_cry)
**Phase**: `.commitmentSystem` → `.commitmentSystem` (War Mode subsection)
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You just picked your sacrifices.
Most people lie here.

"I'll sacrifice comfort."
Then quit when it's uncomfortable.

But YOU'RE DIFFERENT, right?

Prove it.
Create your WAR CRY.

The phrase that pulls you back.
When you're weak.
When you're ready to quit.

Not a mantra.
A WEAPON.
```

**Purpose**: Bridge from abstract sacrifice to concrete activation phrase. Challenges authenticity while building war cry significance.

---

### NEW STEP 41A: After Step 40 (Before External Anchors)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 40 (war mode declaration) and Step 41 (evening_call_time)
**Phase**: `.commitmentSystem` → `.externalAnchors` transition
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
I'm not your friend.
I'm your STRUCTURE.

Internal motivation?
Dead in 72 hours.

You need EXTERNAL accountability:
- Daily calls you can't ignore
- Someone who'll be disappointed
- A failure limit you can't exceed

This isn't self-help.
This is ENGINEERING.

Let's build your cage.
```

**Purpose**: Transition from internal commitment (war cry) to external accountability system. Reframes from motivation to engineering.

---

### NEW STEP 44A: After Step 43 (Before Final Sealing)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 43 (failure_threshold) and Step 44 (final sealing)
**Phase**: `.externalAnchors` → `.externalAnchors` (Final Sealing subsection)
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
System configured:
✓ Daily call scheduled
✓ External judge identified
✓ Failure threshold set

Now there's no escape.

Every day:
I call. You answer.
You report. I judge.

Every failure:
Documented.
Numbered.
Remembered.

Last chance to run.
Or stay and PROVE you're different.

Choose now.
```

**Purpose**: Bridge from system configuration to final commitment. Creates psychological point of no return.

---

## Category 2: Micro-Explanations (3 Steps)

### NEW STEP 10A: After Step 10 (Within Excuse Discovery)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 10 (procrastination_now) and Step 11 (dual sliders)
**Phase**: `.excuseDiscovery`
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
Notice the pattern?

Your FAVORITE excuse.
Your LAST failure.
Your CURRENT procrastination.

All connected.
All the same software.

Most people identify ONE excuse.
You're seeing the PATTERN.

This is rare.
This is dangerous.
This means change is possible.

If you don't quit.
```

**Purpose**: Reinforce that excuse discovery reveals unconscious patterns, not random failures.

---

### NEW STEP 23A: After Step 22 (Within Pattern Analysis)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 22 (financial_consequence) and Step 23 (intellectual_excuse)
**Phase**: `.patternAnalysis`
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
Money not made.
Opportunities missed.
Years wasted.

That number you just said?
That's not just dollars.

That's:
- Freedom you don't have
- Respect you haven't earned
- Security you can't provide

Financial consequences are IDENTITY consequences.

Every dollar you didn't make?
Someone else made it.

While you scrolled.
```

**Purpose**: Elevate financial consequences from abstract to identity-level significance.

---

### NEW STEP 37A: After Step 37 (Within Commitment System)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 37 (streak_target) and Step 38 (sacrifice_list)
**Phase**: `.commitmentSystem`
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You just picked your streak target.

30 days? 60? 100?

Here's the truth:
The number doesn't matter.

DAY 3 matters.
That's when motivation dies.

DAY 7 matters.
That's when 90% quit.

DAY 30 matters.
That's when your brain rewires.

Every day is a DATA POINT.
Proving you're different.
Or proving you're the same.

Which dataset are you building?
```

**Purpose**: Educate on streak psychology and critical inflection points. Reframes from arbitrary number to data collection.

---

## Category 3: Micro-Commitment Confirmations (3 Steps)

### NEW STEP 2A: After Step 2 (After Voice Commitment)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 2 (voice_commitment) and Step 3 (identity_name)
**Phase**: `.warningInitiation`
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
I heard you.
"Why you're really here."

Most people sound confident.
In the recording.

Then they hear it played back.
And realize they were lying.

Your voice will haunt you.
Every time you want to quit.

Are you SURE you're ready?

Because I'm going to use your own words.
Against you.
When you're weak.
```

**Purpose**: Create acknowledgment checkpoint after first vulnerable voice recording. Establishes that their words will be used as accountability.

---

### NEW STEP 32A: After Step 31 (After Breaking Point)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 31 (breaking_point) and Step 32 (biggest_enemy)
**Phase**: `.identityRebuild`
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
You just described your breaking point.
The EVENT that would force you to change.

Death.
Divorce.
Disease.
Financial collapse.

You're waiting for CATASTROPHE.
To give you permission to try.

Pathetic.

But also POWERFUL.

Because you just admitted:
You already know what's coming.
If you don't change.

You HEARD yourself say it.
Acknowledge that.
```

**Purpose**: Force acknowledgment of breaking point revelation. Creates cognitive dissonance between waiting for catastrophe and taking action now.

---

### NEW STEP 40A: After Step 39 (After War Cry)
**Insert Position**: Between Step 39 (war_cry) and Step 40 (war mode declaration)
**Phase**: `.commitmentSystem`
**Type**: `.explanation`

**Prompt**:
```
Your war cry is recorded.
Your voice. Your words.

NOT mine.
YOURS.

When you want to quit Day 7.
I'll play it back.

When you're lying about being "too tired."
I'll play it back.

When you're about to break your promise.
I'll play it back.

This is WHO YOU SAID you are.
On [current date].

Confirm you heard yourself.
This is your identity now.
```

**Purpose**: Create binding acknowledgment of war cry. Establishes recorded commitment as new identity, not temporary motivation.
