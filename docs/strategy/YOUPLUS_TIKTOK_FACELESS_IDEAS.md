# YOU+ FACELESS TIKTOK CONTENT IDEAS

> **Goal:** Daily TikTok content without showing face, maintaining vulnerability/story
>
> **Formats:** App demos, text-on-screen, memes, screen recordings, hand-only shots
>
> **Principle:** Same story, different wrapper

## CORE STRATEGY

### Why Faceless Works for You+

**Your Story = The Hero**
- Product is weird enough to be visual
- The call interface IS the story
- Text overlays maintain vulnerable tone
- Faceless = focus on concept, not personality

**Faceless Advantages:**
- Can create 3-5 per day (no filming yourself)
- Repurpose same footage multiple ways
- Lower barrier = more volume
- Story remains, format changes

---

## CONTENT PILLARS (FACELESS FORMATS)

### 2. TEXT-ON-SCREEN MEMES (30% of content)
Meme templates with your story

### 3. SCREEN RECORDING + COMMENTARY (20% of content)
Record actual call, add text/captions

### 4. HAND-ONLY SHOTS (10% of content)

## VIRAL POTENTIAL ANALYSIS

### Why These Ideas Can Go Viral

**1. Pattern Interrupts**
- Unusual concept (voice clone, AI accountability)
- Unexpected consequences (phone locks, voice apologies)
- Familiar pain (everyone's quit apps)

**2. Emotional Triggers**
- Shame (can't keep promises)
- Curiosity (how does this work?)
- FOMO (73/100 spots taken)

**3. Shareability**
- "This is so me" moment (identification)
- Weird enough to share ("look at this")
- Practical enough to want ("I need this")

**4. Comment Bait**
- Controversial (is this healthy?)
- Relatable (everyone has excuse graveyard)
- Invitation ("if you can't keep promises...")

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Week 1: Test All Formats
- Post 3/day, rotate formats
- Track: Views, comments, shares, saves
- Identify: Which format resonates most?

### Week 2: Double Down
- Focus on top 2 formats
- Create variations
- Optimize hooks

### Week 3: Scale Winners
- Create 5-7/day of winning formats
- Test different story angles
- Build waitlist from bio link

### Metrics to Track

**Engagement Rate > Views**
- 1M views, 100 comments = curiosity
- 50K views, 5K comments = identification ✅

**Save Rate (Key Metric)**
- High saves = valuable content
- Indicates "I want to come back to this"

**Bio Click Rate**
- % of viewers who click link
- Goal: >3% (anything above 2% is good)

---

## CONTENT REPURPOSING (1 IDEA → 5 POSTS)

### Example: "Voice Clone" Concept

**TikTok 1:** Screen recording demo (#5)
**TikTok 2:** Text meme about giving AI your voice (#19)
**TikTok 3:** Hand-only shot of voice recording setup (#26)
**Instagram Reel:** Repurpose TikTok 1
**Twitter Thread:** Write-up of concept with video embed

**1 concept, 1 hour filming, 5 pieces of content**

---

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### ❌ Over-Editing
- Don't add too many effects
- Keep it raw (matches brand)
- Imperfection = authenticity

### ❌ Trending Sounds That Don't Fit
- Don't force trending audio if it doesn't match story
- Original audio or text-to-speech often works better

### ❌ Clickbait Without Delivery
- Don't promise what the app doesn't do
- Maintain honesty ("I'm not sure if this is healthy")

### ❌ Corporate Vibes
- Avoid polished graphics
- Keep scrappy, real
- No stock footage
