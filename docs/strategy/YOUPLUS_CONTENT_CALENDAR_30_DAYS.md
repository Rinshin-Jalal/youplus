# YOU+ 30-DAY CONTENT CALENDAR (VALIDATED STORY FORMAT)

> **Based on:** Reddit post with 300K views
>
> **Goal:** Scale the story that already works across multiple platforms
>
> **Tone:** Vulnerable, uncertain, authentic (like original Reddit post)

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### Core Principle
**Scale the Reddit post format that got 300K views. Don't overthink it.**

### What Made It Work
1. **Vulnerability first** ("I don't even know how to explain this")
2. **Personal failure story** (tried everything, failed)
3. **Weird solution framing** ("something really weird, something kind of messed up")
4. **Humble results** ("three weeks" not "changed my life")
5. **Anti-promotional** ("I'm not saying this to promote anything")
6. **ICP filter** ("If you can't keep your word to yourself")

### Content Pillars (Test These Angles)

**Pillar 1: Failure Loop Stories** (35% of content)
- All the things you've tried and quit
- The moment you realized you can't trust yourself
- Specific failure examples (gym, projects, habits)

**Pillar 2: Weird Solution Framing** (25% of content)
- "I cloned my voice to yell at myself"
- How the calls work
- Why it's strange but effective

**Pillar 3: Consequence Stories** (20% of content)
- What happens when you lie to your future self
- The feeling of answering the call
- How shame works better than motivation

**Pillar 4: ICP Call-Outs** (10% of content)
- "If you've ever said 'I'll start Monday'..."
- "Can you keep promises to yourself?"
- Direct filters for right audience

**Pillar 5: Vulnerable Updates** (10% of content)
- Your ongoing journey
- Days you almost skipped
- Still not sure if it's healthy

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### Reddit (Primary Platform) — 3x/week

**Subreddits to Target:**
- r/GetDisciplined (primary)
- r/productivity
- r/NoFap
- r/DecidingToBeBetter
- r/selfimprovement
- r/getdisciplined

**Format:**
- Title: Curious hook (not promotional)
- Body: 200-400 words, personal story
- No direct links (DM-based or "I'll share if interested")
- Natural mentions in comments

**Example Title Formats:**
- "I [did thing] for 21 days. Here's what actually worked."
- "I can't trust myself to keep promises. So I built something weird."
- "The only thing that's kept me consistent is calling my future self."

**Writing Style:**
- Lowercase, run-ons, typos (authentic)
- Vulnerability first
- Personal story > product pitch
- Anti-promotional stance

---

### Twitter (Daily Threads)

**Format:**
- 10-15 tweet threads
- Start with hook (same as Reddit titles)
- Personal story format
- End with subtle CTA ("If this resonates, DM me")

**Writing Style:**
- Lowercase mostly
- Short sentences, fast pacing
- Line breaks for emphasis
- Raw, unpolished

**Example Opening Tweet:**
```
i've tried 15 different accountability systems

journaling - lasted 4 days
habit trackers - deleted after 2 weeks
accountability partners - ghosted them all

then i built something really weird
```

---

### TikTok (3x/week)

**Format:**
- Face-to-camera, unedited

2. **Call demonstration** (show actual call interface)
3. **Reaction videos** ("Days I almost skipped")

**Hooks:**
- "I get a call from my future self every morning"
- "I cloned my voice to yell at myself"
- "This is the weirdest accountability system I've seen"

**Captions:**
- Same tone as Reddit (lowercase, authentic)

- Optimize titles for search
- Description: Full story (like Reddit post)

**Keywords to Target:**

It's my actual voice, cloned.

Don't do it.
What happens? Nothing.

I built something that adds consequence.
Break a promise?
Phone locks.
Voice apology.
Public accountability.

Three weeks in.
I keep promises now.

Not because I'm motivated.

"Yeah. Me too. Six times this year.

Every time: 'This time will be different.'
It never was.

Until I built something that doesn't let me quit.
Voice calls from my future self.

Three weeks. No misses.

If your hand is still up, this might help."

I show up.

Not because I'm inspired.
Because I said I would.

That's the difference."

## CONTENT EXECUTION GUIDELINES

### Writing Checklist (Use for Every Post)

Before posting, verify:
- [ ] Starts with vulnerability (not promotion)
- [ ] Personal story (not generic advice)
- [ ] Includes "weird" framing (not "innovative solution")
- [ ] Humble results ("three weeks" not "changed my life")
- [ ] Has typos/imperfections (authentic, not polished)
- [ ] Anti-promotional stance ("I'm not saying this to promote...")
- [ ] ICP filter language ("If you can't keep your word to yourself...")
- [ ] No direct product links in body (DM-based or comments)

---

### Engagement Guidelines

**When People Comment:**
1. **Don't pitch immediately** (kills trust)
2. **Share more vulnerability** (builds connection)
3. **Answer questions honestly** (including doubts)
4. **DM structure only if requested** (not pushy)

**Example Responses:**

❌ Bad Response:
"Thanks! You can sign up at [link]"

✅ Good Response:
"Yeah, it's weird. Some days I still hate the call. But I answer anyway. DM me if you want to know more about how it works."

---

### Metrics to Track

**Leading Indicators:**
- Views per post
- Comment depth (are they sharing their stories?)
- "You get me" comments (identification vs. curiosity)
- DMs received
- Email signups from bio/comments

**Conversion Indicators:**
- Click-through to website
- Waitlist signups
- Questions about pricing
- "How do I get this?" messages

**Red Flags:**
- High views, low comments (entertainment, not identification)
- Generic "cool idea" comments (curiosity, not resonance)
- No DMs (story doesn't convert)

---

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC POSTING TIMES

### Reddit
- **Best:** Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9am EST
- **Why:** Catches morning scroll, builds momentum throughout day
- **Avoid:** Weekends (lower engagement on productivity subs)

### Twitter
- **Best:** Monday-Friday, 8-10am EST and 5-7pm EST
- **Why:** Morning commute + evening wind-down
- **Cadence:** Daily threads

### TikTok
- **Best:** 6-9am EST, 12-2pm EST, 7-10pm EST
- **Why:** Before work, lunch break, evening scroll
- **Cadence:** 3x/week minimum

### YouTube Shorts
- **Best:** Same as TikTok
- **Why:** Same user behavior
- **Cadence:** Repurpose TikTok content

---

## CONTENT REPURPOSING MATRIX

| Primary Content | Repurpose To | Adaptation |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Reddit Post | Twitter Thread | Break into 10-15 tweets |
| Reddit Post | TikTok Script | Speak the story, face-to-camera |
| Reddit Post | YouTube Short | Same as TikTok + SEO title |
| Reddit Post | Email Newsletter | Longer form, more reflection |
| TikTok Video | Instagram Reel | Direct repost |
| Twitter Thread | LinkedIn Post | More professional tone (optional) |

**Efficiency Hack:**
- Write Reddit post first (longest form)
- Break into Twitter thread
- Script TikTok version
- Repurpose to YouTube Shorts
- 1 core story = 4+ pieces of content

---

## WEEK 5+ STRATEGY (AFTER 30 DAYS)

### Analyze What Worked
1. Which posts got >50K views?
2. Which angles created "you get me" comments?
3. Which platforms converted best?
4. What story variations resonated most?

### Double Down
- Create 30 more pieces focusing on validated angles
- Test variations of winning formats
- Scale to additional subreddits/platforms

### Layer In User Stories
- Start featuring user testimonials
- "Day 30 update from [User]" posts
- Maintain vulnerable tone (not corporate testimonials)

---

## CONTENT CALENDAR TRACKING

### Weekly Review (Every Sunday)

**Metrics to Review:**
- Total views across platforms
- Top 3 performing posts (why did they work?)
- Conversion rate (views → DMs/emails)
- Comment quality (identification vs. curiosity)

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Which story angles resonated most?
2. Did we maintain vulnerability?
3. Are we drifting toward corporate tone?
4. What should we double down on?

---

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### 🚨 Content Red Flag 1: Over-Polishing
**What it looks like:**
- Removing typos
- Professional editing
- Corporate brand voice

**Fix:** Keep it raw. Typos = authenticity.

---

### 🚨 Content Red Flag 2: Promotional Drift
**What it looks like:**
- "Check out my app!"
- "Download now!"
- Feature lists

**Fix:** Maintain "I'm not saying this to promote anything" stance

---

### 🚨 Content Red Flag 3: Losing Vulnerability
**What it looks like:**
- "This WILL change your life"
- Certainty instead of uncertainty
- Success without struggle

**Fix:** Share struggles. "Almost quit today. Here's why I didn't."

---

### 🚨 Content Red Flag 4: Generic Productivity Positioning
**What it looks like:**
- "Be more productive"
- "10 tips for discipline"
- Comparison to other apps

**Fix:** Stay weird. "I get calls from my future self" > "Daily accountability"

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (AFTER 30 DAYS)

### Content Metrics
- [ ] 10+ posts with >50K views each
- [ ] 20%+ comments show identification ("you get me")
