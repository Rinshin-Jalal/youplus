Design a confrontational accountability mobile app called You+ that uses AI voice calls to keep users disciplined. The app has a pure black background (#000000) with high contrast white text, featuring a prominent hero timer card counting down to the next accountability call displayed in large 64px bold uppercase text. The home screen includes a harsh assessment card with red background (#B22222) showing words like "PATHETIC" or "DISAPPOINTING" in 35px bold text, plus a 2x2 stats grid with colored cards: green (#C8E6C9) for promises made, red (#DC143C) for broken promises, yellow (#FFD700) for streaks, and purple (#8B00FF) for trust percentage. All UI elements are rectangular with no rounded corners, using 3px colored borders and Inter-Bold/Inter-Black fonts with high letter-spacing. The design should feel raw, direct, and confrontational - like your future self holding you accountable - with snappy animations, glitch effects, and pulsing timer animations that accelerate when less than one hour remains. The color psychology uses red for failures, green for success, yellow for achievements, and purple for authority. The target audience is Gen Z individuals who want accountability to themselves (not external judgment) and are tired of gentle productivity apps. The tone is brutally honest with uppercase copy like "STOP LYING TO YOURSELF" and "YOUR FUTURE SELF IS WATCHING" - no sugar-coating, no rounded corners, no pastels, just high contrast black and white with neon accent colors for maximum psychological impact.
