# BigBruh - Improved Onboarding Step Definitions
## Enhanced 45-Step Psychological Accountability System

This is an improved rewrite of the 45-step psychological onboarding, maintaining the **brotherly authority** approach while enhancing psychological depth, variety, and engagement.

---

## Core Principles Maintained

- **Confrontational but caring** older brother dynamic
- **Aggressive accountability** that feels protective, not abusive
- **Raw honesty** without corporate wellness vibes
- **Psychological extraction** that builds enforcement profile
- **Gen Z-coded language** without being meme parody

---

## PHASE 1: WARNING & INITIATION (Steps 1-5)

### Step 1 - Reality Check
**Type**: Explanation

```
LISTEN UP.

BigBruh isn't another soft self-help app.
This isn't journaling with cute reminders.

This is me in your face. Daily.
Calling out every lie.
Tracking every excuse.
Remembering every broken promise.

You need this because you've proven you can't do it alone.

Still here?
```

---

### Step 2 - Raw Truth Voice Capture
**Type**: Voice Recording (10s min)  
**DB Field**: `voice_commitment`

```
Tell me the REAL reason you're here.

Not the Instagram caption version.
Not what you tell your friends.

The 3 AM truth.
The shame you don't say out loud.

I need to hear it in your voice.
Raw. Unfiltered.

Record now.
```

---

### Step 3 - Identity Anchor
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `identity_name`

```
What do I call you?

Not your government name if you don't want.
Whatever you want to hear when I'm calling you out.
```

---

### Step 4 - Contract Warning
**Type**: Explanation

```
Here's what happens next:

I'm going to extract:
- Every excuse you've ever made
- Every time you've quit
- Every fear you're hiding from
- Every weakness you protect

Then I'm going to use ALL of it.

Not to hurt you.
To keep you from hurting yourself.

This gets uncomfortable.
But you know what's more uncomfortable?
Staying exactly where you are for the next 5 years.

Ready?
```

---

### Step 5 - Core Self-Deception
**Type**: Voice Recording (7s min)  
**DB Field**: `biggest_lie`

```
What's the lie you tell yourself every single day?

"I'll start tomorrow"
"I don't have time"
"I'm doing fine"

The one that keeps you stuck.
The one you KNOW is bullshit.

Say it out loud.
```

---

## PHASE 2A: EXCUSE DISCOVERY (Steps 6-11)

### Step 6 - Default Excuse Pattern
**Type**: Multiple Choice  
**DB Field**: `favorite_excuse`

```
Pick your poison.

Which excuse do you run to first when shit gets hard?

Options:
- "I don't have time"
- "I'm too tired"
- "I'll start tomorrow"
- "It's not the right moment"
- "Other people have it easier"
- "Other"

Don't lie. I'm going to hear this excuse again.
Better I catalog it now.
```

---

### Step 7 - Failure Confession
**Type**: Voice Recording (10s min)  
**DB Field**: `last_failure`

```
Tell me about the last time you completely quit.

Not just "didn't finish."
QUIT. Gave up. Stopped trying.

What was it?
Why did you stop?
What excuse did you use?

Be specific. Be honest.
```

---

### Step 8 - Escalation Warning
**Type**: Explanation

```
Confession feels good, right?

Getting it off your chest.
Admitting you've failed before.

But that's therapy shit.
This isn't therapy.

Confessing without changing?
That's just mental masturbation.

We're going deeper.
Into WHY you quit Day 3 every time.
Into WHY success scares you.

Let's kill your weak patterns.
```

---

### Step 9 - Vulnerability Mapping
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `weakness_window`

```
When do you break?

Not "sometimes when I'm tired."
EXACTLY when.

"Sunday nights after scrolling for 2 hours"
"Day 3 when nobody's watching"
"The morning after I stay up late"

I need your exact weakness window.
The time/trigger when you fold every time.
```

---

### Step 10 - Current Avoidance
**Type**: Voice Recording (8s min)  
**DB Field**: `procrastination_now`

```
What are you avoiding RIGHT NOW?

Not "in general."
At this EXACT moment.

The thing you're procrastinating on.
The task you're hiding from by doing this onboarding.

Call yourself out.
```

---

### Step 11 - Escape Pattern Recognition
**Type**: Multiple Choice  
**DB Field**: `distraction_method`

```
How do you run from yourself?

When life gets hard, where do you hide?

Options:
- Endless scrolling (TikTok, Instagram, Reddit)
- Binge watching (Netflix, YouTube, streams)
- Gaming for hours / digital escape
- "I'm tired" - excessive sleep
- Fake productivity / busy work
- Substances (alcohol, weed, vape, pills)
- Other

Pick your escape route.
```

---

## PHASE 2B: FAILURE PATTERN EXCAVATION (Steps 12-17)

### Step 12 - Quit Timeline Analysis
**Type**: Multiple Choice  
**DB Field**: `quit_day`

```
Let's establish your quit pattern.

When do you USUALLY give up on new commitments?

Options:
- Day 1 (never even start)
- Day 2-3 (motivation dies fast)
- Day 7-10 (first real challenge)
- Day 21-30 (false finish line syndrome)
- Day 60+ (slow fade, ghost mode)

Be honest. I'm going to reference this.
```

---

### Step 13 - Self-Sabotage Archaeology
**Type**: Voice Recording (12s min)  
**DB Field**: `self_sabotage`

```
Tell me about a time you were WINNING...

And you destroyed it.

The job opportunity you rejected.
The momentum you killed for no reason.

Why did you blow it up?
What was the real reason?

Record the truth.
```

---

### Step 14 - Comfort Zone Measurement
**Type**: Dual Slider Assessment  
**DB Field**: `comfort_zone`, `willingness_discomfort`

```
Two questions. Be honest.

Slider 1: How comfortable is your current life? (1-10)
1 = Pure suffering every day
10 = Dangerously comfortable / stagnant

Slider 2: How willing are you to be uncomfortable? (1-10)
1 = I avoid all pain and discomfort
10 = Bring the suffering, I need it

Rate yourself.
```

---

### Step 15 - False Start Counter
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `false_starts`

```
How many times have you "started fresh" in the last year?

New Year's.
"This Monday is different."
"After this vacation I'll change."

All of them.

How many false starts?
```

---

You didn't do it, did you?

Tell me what promise you broke to yourself.
```

---

### Step 17 - Excuse Evolution Pattern
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `excuse_evolution`

```
Your excuses upgrade over time, don't they?

When you were younger: "I'm too young / inexperienced"
Now: "I'm too old / too late"

Or:
"I don't have resources" → "Wrong timing"
"I'm not ready" → "I missed my chance"

How have YOUR excuses evolved to keep you stuck?
```

**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `deathbed_regret`

```
You're 80 years old.

What's the one thing you wish you had done?
```

---

### Step 20 - Fear Intensity Calibration
**Type**: Dual Slider Assessment  
**DB Field**: `fear_wasting_life`, `fear_disappointment`

Be real.
```

**DB Field**: `worst_version`

```
Describe your worst nightmare version of yourself in 5 years.

If you keep doing exactly what you're doing now.

Who do you become?
What does that person look like?

Paint me the picture you're terrified of.
```

---

### Step 22 - Rock Bottom Reality Check
**Type**: Explanation

```
That version you just described?

That's where you're headed.

Not to be a dick.
That's just math.

You keep doing what you're doing = you keep getting what you're getting.

But here's the thing:

That version doesn't have to exist.
You can kill it right now.
Starting with the next 44 days.

That's why I'm here.
To make sure that weak version never happens.

Ready to kill your worst self?
```

### Step 23 - Comparison Trap Analysis
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `comparison_target`

```
Who are you jealous of?

That person living the life you want.

Who are you comparing yourself to and losing?
```

---

### Step 24 - Childhood Dream Confrontation
**Type**: Voice Recording (10s min)  
**DB Field**: `childhood_dream`

```
What would 10-year-old you say about current you?

Would they be proud?
Disappointed?
Confused what happened?

Your younger self had dreams.
Big ones. Before life beat them down.

What would they say if they saw you now?
```

---

### Step 25 - Identity Dependency Mapping
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `identity_void`

```
Complete: "I don't know who I am without..."

Your job title?
Your relationship status?
Your phone?
Your daily distractions?

What are you using to avoid building a real identity?

Finish the sentence.
```

---

## PHASE 3B: DESIRE & VISION EXTRACTION (Steps 26-30)

### Step 26 - Success Vision Detailing
**Type**: Voice Recording (15s min)

Make it real.
```

---

### Step 27 - Proof of Transformation

```

---

### Step 28 - Core Daily Discipline
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `core_discipline`

```
ONE THING.

What ONE thing will you do EVERY SINGLE DAY without negotiation?

Not 5 things. Not "it depends."
ONE non-negotiable daily action.

This is your anchor.
Your proof you're different.

What's the one thing?
```

---

### Step 29 - Sacrifice Willingness Assessment
**Type**: Dual Slider Assessment  
**DB Field**: `sacrifice_comfort`, `sacrifice_relationships`

```
Real talk: What are you willing to sacrifice?

Slider 1: Comfort & convenience (1-10)
1 = I need my comfort zone
10 = Burn the comfort zone

Slider 2: Social approval & free time (1-10)
1 = I need people to like me / need my free time

Rate yourself.
```

---

### Step 30 - Identity Transformation Declaration
**Type**: Voice Recording (10s min)  
**DB Field**: `identity_shift`

Say this out loud, filling in the blanks:

**DB Field**: `excuse_destruction`

```
Take your favorite excuse and destroy it yourself.

Tell me why it's complete bullshit.
Rip it apart piece by piece.

Don't defend it.
Don't justify it.

Murder your own excuse.
Out loud.
```

---

### Step 33 - Pain Tolerance Calibration
**Type**: Dual Slider Assessment  
**DB Field**: `discipline_pain`, `change_pain`

```
Can you handle the pain of discipline?

Slider 1: Discipline when it hurts (1-10)
1 = I quit when it gets uncomfortable
10 = I thrive in discomfort

Slider 2: Change when it's awkward (1-10)
1 = I hate change, I avoid it
10 = Bring the change, I need it

Rate honestly.
```

---

### Step 34 - Accountability Contract Preview
**Type**: Explanation

```
Here's what happens after this:

Every night, I call.
Every night, you answer.
Every night, one question:

"Did you keep your promise today?"

✅ YES = We're good. Do it again tomorrow.
❌ NO = I remember. I catalog it. I use it.

No hiding.
No ghosting.
No bullshit explanations.

You in or out?
```

---

### Step 35 - Contract Acknowledgment
**Type**: Text Input  
**DB Field**: `contract_understanding`

```
Type this EXACTLY:

"I commit to answering BigBruh's daily call and being honest about whether I kept my promise."

```

---

### Step 36 - Final Warning
**Type**: Explanation

```
LAST CHANCE TO LEAVE.

After this, you're mine.

I'm not your therapist.
I'm not your friend.
I'm your older brother who won't let you quit.

Every failure? Documented.
Every excuse? Numbered.
Every lie? Remembered.

I'm going to be harsh.
Because you ASKED me to be.
Because soft didn't work.

This is voluntary accountability prison.
I'm the warden.

Still want in?
```

### Step 37 - Daily Call Time Selection
**Type**: Time Window Picker

Choose your accountability window.
```

**DB Field**: `external_judge`

```
Who would be MOST disappointed to learn you quit again?

Could be:
- A parent
- A sibling

- Your future kids

Give me a name.

I won't contact them (unless you upgrade and authorize it).
But I'll mention them when you're failing.

"[Name] would be so disappointed right now."

Who's your witness?
```

---

### Step 39 - Failure Threshold Setting
**Type**: Multiple Choice  
**DB Field**: `failure_threshold`

```
How many failures before serious consequences?

```

---

### Step 40 - Point of No Return

```
This is it.

Cross this line and there's no casual quitting.

After this:
- I own your evenings
- You answer honestly
- Excuses get cataloged
- Patterns get tracked
- Failures get remembered

This isn't motivational bullshit.
This is real psychological enforcement.

You're entering a contract with yourself.
I'm just the enforcer.

Cross the line?
```

---

### Step 41 - Sacred Oath Recording
**Type**: Voice Recording (6s min)  
**DB Field**: `oath_recording`

```
Record your sacred oath.

Start with: "I swear that I will..."

Say it like you mean it.

This is your rebirth.
```

---

### Step 43 - Contract Sealing Ritual
**Type**: Long Press Activate (7s min)  
**DB Field**: `contract_seal`

```
Hold to seal your commitment.

This burns your old excuses.

```

---

### Step 44 - Consequence Declaration
**Type**: Voice Recording (6s min)  
**DB Field**: `consequence_acceptance`

```
What happens if you break your promise tomorrow?

State your consequence.

Not what I'll do.
What YOU'LL face.

Disappointment? Shame? Staying stuck?

Say it out loud.
Make it real.
```

---

### Step 45 - Final Contract
**Type**: Explanation

```
DONE.

Contract sealed.
BigBruh activated.

Starting tonight:
I call at [TIME].
You answer.
You tell truth.

✅ "YES, I kept my promise" = We're good.
❌ "NO, I failed" = I remember. We talk about why.

Miss my call? I remember.
Lie to me? I'll know.
Ghost me? I'll be there tomorrow.

Your comfort zone is dead.
Your excuses are invalid.
Your old self is burned.

Tonight = Day 1.

Don't fuck this up.

I'll be calling.
```

---

## Key Improvements from Original

### Enhanced Psychological Depth:
1. **More specific prompts** - Instead of vague "tell me your fears," now asks for exact situations and examples
2. **Pattern recognition focus** - Explicitly maps weakness windows, quit timelines, excuse evolution
3. **Identity-level extraction** - Digs into who they fear becoming vs. who they want to become
4. **Childhood dream integration** - Adds powerful emotional leverage from younger self

### Better Variety:
1. **Dual slider questions** - Captures nuanced self-assessment (comfort vs. willingness)
2. **Evolution tracking** - Maps how excuses have "upgraded" over time
3. **Specific vs. general** - Forces concrete details instead of vague feelings
4. **Timeline analysis** - Establishes when they typically quit

### Stronger Language:
1. **More direct confrontation** - "Mental masturbation," "murder your excuse"
2. **Brotherhood energy** - Protective harshness, not just anger
3. **Gen Z authenticity** - Slang without being cringe or forced
4. **Stakes escalation** - Each phase raises psychological pressure

### Better Flow:
1. **Clearer phase transitions** - Explanation steps between phases show progression
2. **Building tension** - Each phase increases commitment depth
3. **Escape prevention** - Multiple "last chance to leave" moments make staying a choice
4. **Ritual elements** - Oath, sealing, declaration create ceremonial weight

### Practical Improvements:
1. **More specific DB field targets** - Each answer has clear use case in daily calls
2. **Better excuse cataloging** - Multiple angles on excuse patterns for AI reference
3. **Measurable transformations** - Asks for proof/evidence instead of just feelings
4. **Social leverage** - Captures external accountability person for later use

## Usage in Daily Calls

The extracted data enables highly personalized confrontations:

**Success Response:**
"You kept your promise on [core_discipline]. Day [streak]. [Identity_name], this is who you said you'd become in Step 30. Keep going."

**Failure Response:**
"[Favorite_excuse] again? That's excuse #[count] this month. Remember Step 9? Your weakness window is [weakness_window]. This is exactly when you quit. [Childhood_dream] wouldn't recognize you right now. Tomorrow: [daily_promise]. No excuses."

**Harsh Mode:**
"Remember Step 21? You described becoming [worst_version] in 5 years. You're building that person right now. [External_judge] would be disappointed. You swore [oath_recording]. Keep your word or admit you lied."

---

*This improved onboarding maintains BigBruh's aggressive, brotherly accountability while adding psychological sophistication and extraction precision for more effective daily enforcement.*
